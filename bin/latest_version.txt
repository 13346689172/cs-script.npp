Release v1.7.8

This is the first truly portable release. The same plugin binaries are running on both x86 and x64 versions of Notepad++.
Special thanks to @kbilsted for his excellent kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net x64 compatible Notepad++ managed hosting solution.

This version can only be installed via PluginManager or manually. The plugin's own embedded updater will be able to check and perform future updates after v1.7.8 is installed.

* x64 migration
 - Implemented NppPlugin.Host loosely coupled CPU specific launcher
 - CSScriptIntellisense+CSScriptNpp made AnyCPU
 - Changed updater.exe to meet new x64 requirements
 - All NPP API code migrated to CPU neutral interface.
 - Updated packaging process to support x64.
 - Fixed nasty problem with interop corrupting unamanged memory. `Npp.Editor.GetOpenFiles` replaced with more conservative but safer `Npp.Editor.GetOpenFilesSafe`
 - Merged CSScriptIntellisense.Npp and SScriptNpp.Npp classes

* Plugin functionality changes and fixes
 - All plugin's references to the external resources are changed from CodePlex (R.I.P.) to GitHub.
 - Autocompletion user experience made consistent (e.g. suggestion filtering) with Visual Studio Intellisense.
 - Added `Config.Instance.InterceptConsoleByCharacter` (false by default) to allow faster ConsoleOutput rendering
 - Added `Config.BlockLocalDebugOutputContaining` to block unwanted Debug output content.
 - Added `Config.StartDebugMonitorOnScriptExecution` to prevent auto-attaching DBMon as it can cause significant startup delay for any process being started from the common parent (Notepad++ exe).

* Fixes
 - Fixed debugger current step marker rendering problem
 - Various loading optimization changes.
 - Added extra error handling in custom-draw CodeMap routine.
