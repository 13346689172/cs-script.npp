Release v1.7.3-5

* The AboutBox "Restore file structure" has been removed as the immanent fix for the Plugin Manager defect has been confirmed by the Notepad++ support.
  (Special thanks to @CollinChaffin who investigated the problem)

* RoslynIntellisense.exe has been moved into Roslyn folder to minimize Roslyn custom assembly probing for C# 7.

* Roslyn services are now terminated on Notepad++ exit. To avoid interference with Plugin Manager updates.

* Updater changes:
  - Updates are now "by replacement" instead of "by merge". Just to avoid the dll conflicts.
  - Improved error messages and focus management for message boxes.
  - Ensured that N++ restarted as non elevated process during plugin updates.
  - Updater has made into a stand alone `version manager` with external interface.
