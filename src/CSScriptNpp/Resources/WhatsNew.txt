Release v1.5.0
* Added preventing triggering GoToDefinition on Ctrl+LeftMouseClick when there is a text selection.
* Added CLR version label to AboutBox.
* Fixed flickering on project reload.
* Generation of the script project is now based on the script directory as "CurrentDirectory" thus script dependencies during project structure generation are resolved the same way as for execution.
* CS-Script engine update (v3.18.1)
* Addressed "overlapping" between Notepad++ native bracket auto-insertion and C# MethodInfo tooltip.
