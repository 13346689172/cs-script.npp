Release v1.7.2

* The AboutBox "Restore file structure" has been removed as the fix for the Plugin Manager has been confirmed by the Notepad++ support.
Special thanks to @CollinChaffin who investigated the problem.

* Fixed problem with the invalid probing directory (Roslyn assembly probing for C# 7) in Roslyn.Intellisense.exe.
