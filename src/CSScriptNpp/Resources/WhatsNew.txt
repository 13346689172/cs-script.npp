v1.0.50.1
* Fixed problem for autocompletion at the very end of the code line.
v1.0.50.0
* Added support for C# 6.0 Intellisense (auto-completion). Previously only formatting and script execution was available.
  It is a serious milestone, which opens the road for gradual phasing out the NRefactory parsers in favor of Roslyn. 
* Updated embedded SC-Script engine to the latest v3.12.1.0 (NuGet and misc usability improvements)
