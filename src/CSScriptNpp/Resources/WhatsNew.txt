* Added 'GoToDefinition' on Ctrl+LeftClick
* Added context menu with C# Intellisense commands
* Added auto-disabling C# 6 Intellisense if it fails to initialize (e.g. .NET v4.6 is missing).

-------------
C# 6 syntax support is based on Roslyn (requires .NET v4.6).
It is disabled by default but can be enabled from the settings dialog.

Roslyn is a MS technology that is constantly evolving. Please report any problems with Roslyn as your feedback is vital for improving C# 6 support
