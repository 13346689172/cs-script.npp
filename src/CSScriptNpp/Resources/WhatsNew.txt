Release v1.7.8

The first truly portable release. The same plugin binaries are running on both x86 and x64 versions of Notepad++ 
Special thanks to @kbilsted for his excellent kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net x64 compatible Notepad++ managed hosting solution.

* x64 migration
 - Implemented NppPlugin.Host loosely coupled CPU specific launcher
 - CSScriptIntellisense+CSScriptNpp made AnyCPU
 - Changed updater.exe to meet new x64 requirements
 - All NPP API code migrated to CPU neutral interface.
 - Updated packaging process to support x64.
 - Fixed nasty problem with interop corrupting unamanged memory. `Npp.Editor.GetOpenFiles` replaced with more conservative but safer `Npp.Editor.GetOpenFilesSafe`
 - Merged CSScriptIntellisense.Npp and SScriptNpp.Npp classes 

* Plugin functionality changes and fixes
 - Autocompletion user experience made consistent (e.g. suggestion filtering) with Visual Studio Intellisense.
 - Added `Config.Instance.InterceptConsoleByCharacter` (false by default) to allow faster ConsoleOutput rendering
 - Added `Config.BlockLocalDebugOutputContaining` to block unwanted Debug output content.
 - Added `Config.StartDebugMonitorOnScriptExecution` to prevent auto-attaching DBMon as it can cause significant startup delay for any process being started from the common parent (Notepad++ exe).

* Fixes
 - Fixed debugger current step marker rendering problem
 - Various loading optimization changes.
 - Added extra error handling in custom-draw CodeMap routine.
