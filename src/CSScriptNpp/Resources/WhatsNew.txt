v1.2.1.0
* Fixed 'competition' between N++ and CSScript.Npp auto-indentation 
* Asynchronous starting Roslyn server at N++ startup is made a default behavior. The change dramatically improves UX by eliminating/hiding Roslyn startup delay. 
The change became justified after long testing over numerous releases didn't reveal any serious issues associated with Roslyn.
* Implemented setting the custom host for script AsyncRun.
